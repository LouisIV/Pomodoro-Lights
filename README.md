# Pomodoro Lights
I'm someone who loves the idea of Pomodoro clocks. I say the idea because I can never seem to hold myself to actually take a break when the alarm goes off. Having tried almost every app in the App Store I realized it would be great if I could just make it impossible for me to ignore the timer. Maybe by turning the lights off?
